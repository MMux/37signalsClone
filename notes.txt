Pseudocode:

When the page loads, the arrows will have display:none

When the user hovers over the product box <a>, the arrows need to toggleClass or remove? to display

The div which contains the text needs to have its content swapped upon the hover over a product box. 

One way to do this is to toggle the content and the css for the h1 and h3 elements

This applies to each of the 3 product boxes.
